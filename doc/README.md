# Bad Jokes to Spend a Cloudy Afternoon Indoors

![What's that ruckus out here?][img-open-window]


A horse walks into a bar. Bartender says, "Why the long face?"

Granted, a bit of a trite joke, but also a cornerstone in the history of
humour inside the equine community.

Two chemists walk into a bar. The first one says, "I'll have a glass of
H~2~O". The second one says, "I'll have a glass of H~2~O too". The second
one died of poisoning.
<div class="comment">
Man... I don't even understand one lick of chemistry and I still find this
hilarious. What is wrong with me?

A rope goes into a bar and orders a drink. Bartender says, "We don't serve
ropes in here. GET OUT!"

Rope sees his pal outside and explains what happened. His pal ties him into
a knot, unravels a few of his strands at the ends, and then sends him back
into the bar.

Bartender says, "Aren't you that rope I just kicked out of here?!". Rope
says, "No. I'm a frayed knot."

Puns based on word kung--fu might just be my favourite kind of pun. This
is probably the reason why I could read L. Carroll's works for all eternity
and never get tired of them.

One day, a silly little programmer decides to create a silly little
JavaScript library that could help others create innovative and inspiring
programs by importing media assets from public URLs. He creates a detailed
document explaining how to use this library, and then ---in a gesture of
utter *naïveté*--- he includes an entire section devoted to explaining the
issues of copyrights and trademarks.

His intention was to combat the ignorance concerning the use of works
created by others, at least as far as it concerns software written by
beginners who are not yet familiar with the way this strange and ruthless
world we live in works.

The last thing this programmer expected to see was his library being used
to create some public program that blatantly ripped--off copyrighted
material on the internet. "If I make my best effort to explain the basic
rules of usage in this document, and place them right at the top, under the
title **Important Notice**, surely people will read this, and everything
will be fine", he thought.

What a fool.

<div class="comment">
Wait, that's it? Where's the punchline?

Ohh, I see what you did here. This is one of those cases where it's funny
'cause it's true.

Help me Father. Some days I feel like the heavy burden over my heart is too
much. Some days I feel like I'm at the rope's end and there is no hope for
any of us.

![Oh, I love humanity, it's people that I cannot stand][img-big-head]

I mean, when I think of people who spend their time doing something I love,
like programming, I can't help but to form a picture in my mind of how
someone like that might be, and I ascribe certain traits to that picture. I
imagine, for example, that such a person (some who *codes*) would make some
effort to read software documentation, and at least spend a few moments to
understand the implications of what is explained there.

I'd like nothing more but to be one with *all* of my fellow programmers.
To play with them in this large sandbox we call Universe and help bring more
light into this darkness. It's just difficult, some days.

Some days I feel like praying to Mother to come down and wash it all away,
as the song goes.

![I mean, seriously.. ripping off graphics and music from a widely popular
Nintendo game?!][img-beard]

I know this might be just a pointless exercise at this point, but here's one
last attempt to get this important information across: if you have some time
to spare (I think you do, given that you're reading this), please [read this
important information][ip-faq]. It will do you good.

And so, we reach the end of this story, my friends. Soon, this URL will
contain nothing but emptiness, and all of this will be nothing but a dim
memory in the collective consciousness.

I'll confide a little secret to you: my main consolation at times like this,
is in the words popularized by of our good friend Gautama..
